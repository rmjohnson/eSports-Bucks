eSports Bucks

A tournament organization tool for online communities, designed to be simple and quick for all members of the tournament process. Community leaders create a community on the site, and then members join under that community. A tournament is set up with map pool, date and time, max players, and a prize pool (either cash or "eSports Bucks"). The tournament then has a permament link that players can use to sign up. Once the time of the tournament comes, players sign in and are shown a simple page that displays their opponent and the map they will be playing on. Each player is required to hit a check in button before a certain time. The game is then played and then both players are required to upload the replay to verify the results. The forced replay upload might be made optional, set by the community organizer. After the game is verified, each player is then show their next opponent and map. This is repeated until a winner is decided. The community organizers can decide to either offer up a cash prize or eSports Bucks. Each community has their own leaderboard for eSports Bucks. These can also be used in betting within the community, such as on the finals of the tournament.
